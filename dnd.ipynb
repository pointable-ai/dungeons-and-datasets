If the creature does so, it can't see Kyrilla until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Kyrilla in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\\nKyrilla's accursed gaze does not affect undead or constructs. If Kyrilla sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she is, due to her curse, affected by her own gaze.\\nSunlight Sensitivity\\nWhile in sunlight, Kyrilla has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\\n\", 'action': \"Multiattack\\nKyrilla makes one attack to constrict and two attacks with her claws, or she makes three attacks with her longbow.\\nClaw\\n{@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 3d6 + 3}) slashing damage.\\nConstrict\\n{@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 3d6}) bludgeoning damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}) if it is a Large or smaller creature.

The swarm is under Kyrilla's control and acts on her turn, immediately after her in the initiative order.\\nIt remains in existence for up to 1 hour. She can summon no more than three swarms per day. Kyrilla can banish any or all of her summoned swarms with a bonus action.\\n\", 'legendary': 'Claw\\nKyrilla or a swarm of poisonous snakes makes a weapon attack.\\nDetect\\nKyrilla makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\\nSlither\\nKyrilla moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.\\n', 'descriptions': 'Some small part of Kyrilla hopes she might be pardoned from her immortal curse one day, but her ire and spite have overtaken her heart, and the only way she can imagine escaping eternity is by impressing the gods with her tenacity. She doesn\\'t want pity nor compassion. She wants to be feared and loathed and to press on with existence despite it all. And now that Kathikon is dead and she is alone, she cannot remember mercy.\\n\"I am quick to judge others and find them wanting.\"\\n\"Spite. I survive despite a curse from the gods—I\\'m not about to go out into the world where fools will try to kill me.\"\\n\"Kathikon was the love of my life. No one else matters to me.\"\\n\"I never admit when I am wrong.\"\\nOnce, Kyrilla looked much like other gorgons of her world. Now, with her curse upon her, Kyrilla\\'s healthy greenish skin has grown sickly pale, and the segmented cables she wore like hair have gone from shiny black to matte gray and green. Her legs became a long, segmented tail. Her eyes now glow green, bright enough to create dim light in front of her. She has grown four needle-like fangs in her mouth, and her hands have become slicing claws.\\nShe reverts to her original appearance when she dies.\\nThe malevolent powers bestowed to Kyrilla by her curse, as well as those given to her by the yuan-ti cult, are hardly of interest to her. She doesn\\'t relish power but instead has taken to wallowing in misery and dwelling in her hatred for the beings that cursed her so long ago that she can hardly remember them.\\nKyrilla wears a ring of water walking that she was given by an emissary from the Serpent Kingdoms long ago. It is made of a bluish jade and does not reflect light.\\nKyrilla does not require food or drink but does breathe and sleep.\\n'}\n"
