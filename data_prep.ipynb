For by the time those glowing red eyes fix on you, it's far too late to run...\\nSome adventurers and sages whisper that deep crows were first spawned as the familiars of evil arcane casters, abandoned in the subterranean depths and left to grow to enormous size. Others claim these creatures were once normal crows transmuted by vile essence and viler powers. But one thing all agree on is that ending up a meal for one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into their deadly lairs.\\nThough the deep crow most immediately resembles a massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avian insect. Seen up close, it can easily be discerned from any other giant bird by its insectoid maw, its four-clawed feet, and the cluster of red eyes that are the most unsettling part of its appearance.\\nThe deep crow's most fearsome attack is the bite of its mandibles, which can seize and hold almost any creature. Their preferred attack is a snatch-and-grab that sees a deep crow flying off with a living victim before its companions have any chance of counterattack. Provided the doomed prey doesn't struggle, the deep crow takes it back to its lair to be devoured at leisure. Creatures that do struggle might be repeatedly dropped from a height to soften them up a bit.\\nDeep crows live alone for an unknown length of years, emerging from the lair only to hunt, to look for potential threats, and to mate. Mating is a once-in-a-lifetime urge that sees each deep crow involved in the pairing produce a cluster of four to eight eggs. Incubation lasts a year, followed by a year during which the fledgling deep crows stay close by their parent's side. The young then set out to establish lairs of their own.\\nThe mindset of these intelligent yet alien creatures is a mystery, but some who have encountered them relate that they are quick to hold a grudge. For years. Of even greater importance, they can teach their chicks to harbor the same resentments, instilling a cross-generational hatred of chosen foes that can last for centuries.\\nDeep crows and ancient deep crows roost in places both deep and warm, favoring sites with access to exposed lava. The spires of volcanic rock the creatures prize as roosts are common in such places, whose ambient warmth provides constant temperature regulation for the creature's eggs.\\n\"}\n",

More immediately notable is the unique physical trait that all members of his clan bear-a stylish tail that is rare and often considered a deformity among dragonborn.\\nAs with his tail, an odd quirk of heritage makes Donaar\\'s acid breath more of a signature vomiting, giving rise to a driving paranoia that this regurgitation might damage his teeth. As testaments to his obsession with dental hygiene, Donaar named his greatsword Toothbrush and calls his whip Floss. He carries an actual toothbrush (named Percival) and actual floss at all times.\\nThose who know Donaar quickly come to recognize that the braggadocio that defines him involves a certain amount of artifice. When the young dragonborn left his clan and family to adventure in foreign climes, he realized that doing so provided the perfect opportunity to reinvent himself for folk who had no idea what he was once like. As such, Donaar has learned that no amount of bravado and compensation is too much-provided he leaves no openings for strangers to call him on it. By the same token, strangers quickly come to realize that reinforcing Donaar\\'s self-congratulating sense of draconic entitlement makes it remarkably easy to win his favor.\\nDespite his easily massaged vanity, the dragonborn sometimes shows the occasional streak of selflessness. Most notably, Donaar serves in his off-hours as parttime godfather to a young dragonborn named Chronaar, who had inadvertently imprinted on Donaar as a parental figure while he watched over her while she was in her egg.\\n'}\n",

The robe allows him to cast the following spells: 6/day: {@spell magic missile} (7 missiles)\\nAwakened Mind\\nK'thriss can telepathically speak to any creature he can see within 30 feet of him, provided the creature can understand at least one language.\\nFey Ancestry\\nK'thriss has advantage on saving throws against being {@condition charmed}, and magic can't put him to sleep. Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, K'thriss has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\\n\", 'action': \"Multiattack\\nK'thriss makes two attacks with his sickle.\\nSickle\\n{@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}4 ({@damage 1d4 + 2}) slashing damage.\\n\", 'descriptions': 'All things are divided into meat and mouths-but even a mouth is just meat.\\nThe drow warlock K\\'thriss Drow\\'b cuts a dashing figure as the worldly representative of the Ur-a ravenous, inscrutable, and largely indifferent elder entity from beyond reality. Tapped into this dark power, the \"C\" Team\\'s hoards person sees all existence as a puzzle to unlock, and he is obsessed by the essential lack of meaning and purpose in the structures of so-called \"reality.\" Still, all things considered, he is most often polite and affable. Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can\\'t afford to make more enemies.\\nGiven his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K\\'thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow\\'s hair jet-black. His matching \"beard\" is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K\\'thriss believes makes him look distinguished. Possessed of alarming and asymmetric crystalline eyes, he often wears a blindfold to spare others his visage, seeing through the eyes of his familiar while he does.\\nTentacles play a big part in K\\'thriss\\'s spellcasting, whether wrenching him through the sky when he uses magic to fly, or manifesting in dark, suckered form when he casts spells such as thorn whip. And when enemies hear K\\'thriss whisper the deep truths of the Ur-typically something about how on a geologic time scale, everyone\\'s desires are meaningless-they remember it.\\nK\\'thriss\\'s familiar, Ligotti, is a semisapient remnant of a tentacle attack, spawned by the warlock\\'s intercessor patron god. Though entirely alien to the material plane (and often appearing in the form of a staff), Ligotti uses the stat block of a poisonous snake with these changes:\\n'}\n"
